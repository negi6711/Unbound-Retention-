# Unbound-Retention-
This project a replica of the kindof project I worked on professionally on a vely larger scale database 
Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/braniac2000/retail-dataset


A client I worked with in a retail project requested a retention report for a specified period. The challenge was to not only provide the retention rate, but also identify which campaigns were less successful and resulted in lower-value customers.

To address the client's request, I conducted extensive research and decided to first obtain the unbound retention rate using SQL on the client's database hosted on Azure. The unbound retention rate represented the number of users who returned and made a transaction on a specific day or later. After validating the results, I created a comprehensive report using Microsoft Excel that highlighted the months with a lower number of high-value customers. The report offered insights into the less successful campaigns and helped the client make informed business decisions.

The results of the analysis were quite intriguing. Our findings indicated that the customer quality experienced a decline during the period from September to December 2011. Upon further investigation of the records, we discovered that the Facebook marketing campaigns during that time were not executed by the team that the client originally had a contract with. This information provided valuable insights into the factors that influenced customer quality.
